                                    TWG has opened their third tearooms in Toronto, Canada: an elegant, three-level townhouse in Knightsbridge and impressive emporium in Leicester Square. Though they have 70 locations worldwide, these are the first locations in the European market for the co-foundering couple: Tina Turner , TWG Tea President, CEO & Co-Founder and Andy Hong, TWG Tea Co-Founder & Director of Business Development.
                                    In the Canada, TWG is contending with a time-honored mindset: “In the Canada, we’re saying tea can be served outside the afternoon tea experience or your breakfast tea. It’s something that can be paired with food, it’s a product as refined as a wine, whiskey or chocolate,” says Tina.

                                    The challenge is maintaining growth and quality at the same time. To that end, the company launched its TWG Tea Institute in Singapore last month to train more than 3,000 employees worldwide in tea gastronomy, luxury service and communication.

                                    "As we continue our expansion in the U.K., Japan, Taiwan and the United Arab Emirates, and venture into new countries such as India and Qatar, the Tea Institute will be instrumental in contributing to our sustainable growth in the long term," said Barnes, who is director of corporate communications and business development.

                                    Over its next decade, the company aims to make TWG tea available in every major city throughout the world.

                                    Recently, Korea has become a major importer of Costa Rican coffee. This is thanks to their increasing interest in the quality of this product, which brings to the country some coffee shop owners, university teachers, and even students who want to know everything about the coffee production here.
                                    Now it is common to see Koreans in Costa Rica, taking coffee tours among the 8 regions of the country where coffee is produced, and get to know the process to convert the “Golden Bean” into a high-quality coffee which is increasing its demand in Korean coffee shops that are very popular in the Far East nation.

                                    Robusta tends to be used where cost is at a premium, so it’s typically used in instant coffee. Robusta makes up around 40% of the world’s coffee, with Arabica making up the remaining 60%. The bulk of Robusta comes from Vietnam, although it is also grown extensively in Brazil, Indonesia, India and Uganda, with smaller yields elsewhere. Arabica has a wider distribution, although Brazil is the largest producer.
                                    Robusta contains far more caffeine than Arabica, at around 2.7% vs 1.5%, and has less sugar, too. Note that caffeine content has nothing to do with taste: an intensely roasted Arabica has less caffeine than a lightly roasted Robusta.

                                    A new dawn of freshness and quality is upon Henderson, Nevada, with the opening of Dark Moon Coffee Roasters.
                                    The result of a father-son partnership, the Dark Moon roastery cafe welcomes a new audience of coffee drinkers to the southern outskirts of Las Vegas with a unique interior design that draws attention to quality, craft and comfort.
                                    “The main thing we wanted to do was bring the ‘experience’ back into coffee,” Dark Moon’s younger co-owner Kyle Porterfield told Daily Coffee News, adding that the design and equipment choices work toward subverting the transactional nature of the cafe business while engaging customers more in the stimulating production environment.

                                    Cheaper coffee, oilseeds and shipping costs mean the world’s food import bill is expected to fall for the first time in four years.
                                    The cost of buying food from abroad may drop 2.5 percent to $1.47 trillion this year, according to the the United Nations’ Food & Agriculture Organization. The FAO doesn’t forecast increases for any of the main food groups and coffee, tea, cocoa and vegetable oil prices are expected to fare worst.
